## üêõ Debugging & Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail
- [ ] Check imports are correct

- [ ] Check mocks are configured
- [ ] Look for async timing issues
- [ ] Check error messages carefully

### If Forms Don't Validate
- [ ] Verify zodResolver imported
- [ ] Check schema is correct
- [ ] Ensure form.handleSubmit wraps onSubmit
- [ ] Check FormMessage components present
- [ ] Verify field names match schema

### If Code Splitting Doesn't Work
- [ ] Check lazy() is used for imports
- [ ] Verify Suspense wraps Routes
- [ ] Check fallback is provided
- [ ] Rebuild: `npm run build`
- [ ] Clear cache and rebuild

### If Coverage is Low
- [ ] Identify untested files
- [ ] Focus on high-value code first
- [ ] Add tests incrementally
- [ ] Use coverage report to guide
- [ ] Don't aim for 100% everywhere
