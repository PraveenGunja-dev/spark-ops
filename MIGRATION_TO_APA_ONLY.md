# Migration to Maestro Platform (APA-Powered)

## 🎯 Objective
Complete removal of traditional orchestrator/automation features from Spark-Ops, transforming it into the **Maestro Platform**—a pure AI agent management interface powered by **Agentic Process Automation (APA)** as the execution layer.

## 🏗️ Architecture Clarity

**Maestro** = Platform Layer (Interface)
- User interface and dashboards
- Agent management and configuration
- Workflow orchestration
- Monitoring and analytics

**APA** = Execution Layer (Engine)
- ReAct reasoning engine
- Semantic memory and context
- Tool execution runtime
- Safety guardrails

Think of Maestro as the **cockpit** and APA as the **engine** that runs the agents.

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. **Routing Restructure** (`src/App.tsx`)

**Removed Routes**:
- `/dashboard` → Redirects to `/maestro`
- `/runs` and `/runs/:id`
- `/agents` (old orchestrator version)
- `/workflows` (traditional workflows)
- `/tools` (traditional connectors)
- `/approvals` (old approval system)
- `/evaluations`
- `/analytics`
- `/policies`
- `/settings` (old settings)
- `/workflows/builder`
- `/workflows/studio`
- `/test`

**New APA/Maestro Routes**:
- `/maestro` - Main dashboard (APA)
- `/maestro/agents` - AI Agents management
- `/maestro/agents/:id` - Agent details with reasoning traces
- `/maestro/workflows` - Autonomous workflows
- `/maestro/observability` - Real-time monitoring
- `/maestro/governance` - Safety & policies
- `/maestro/hitl` - Human-in-the-Loop dashboard
- `/maestro/integrations` - Tool integrations
- `/maestro/settings` - Platform settings
- `/profile` - User profile (within Maestro layout)
- `/teams` - Team management (within Maestro layout)

**Redirect Rules**:
- `/dashboard` → `/maestro` (automatic redirect)
- `/orchestrator/*` → `/maestro` (catch-all redirect)

### 2. **Sidebar Navigation** (`src/components/layout/MaestroSidebar.tsx`)

**Added**:
- "Human-in-the-Loop" menu item with `AlertCircle` icon

**Updated Menu Structure**:
```
Main Navigation:
├── Maestro Home (Dashboard)
├── AI Agents
├── Workflows
├── Observability
├── Human-in-the-Loop (NEW)
├── Governance
└── Integrations

System:
├── Back to Home
└── Settings
```

### 3. **Landing Page Redesign** (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)

**Before**: Dual-choice landing page (Orchestrator vs Maestro)

**After**: Single-purpose APA showcase

**New Features**:
- Prominent Maestro branding
- APA feature highlights:
  - 🧠 ReAct Reasoning
  - ⚡ Semantic Memory
  - 🛡️ Human-in-the-Loop
  - 👁️ Full Observability
- Direct "Launch Maestro Platform" button

- Powered by: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, ChromaDB

### 4. **Layout Consolidation**

**Removed**:
- `AppLayout` (traditional orchestrator layout)
- `AppSidebar` (traditional navigation)

**Primary Layout**:
- `MaestroLayout` - Now the only application layout
- All pages use MaestroLayout for consistent APA experience
